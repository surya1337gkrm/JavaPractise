# 15. Reading Input from an user

If we want to print some information to the console, we use `System.out.println` method. Here `out` is a Static variable defined in the System class which of **printStream** type. **printStream** class has multiple methods implemented. println & print are few among those methods which can be used to print the data.

Simillarly, we can read the data from the user using a static variable ( **in** ) defined in the System class of type inputStream. There are few methods defined in the inputStream class like read which we can use to read the data from the user.

`System.in.read()` returns an int value i.e, when user gives an input first, read method will read the first byte of the input stream and returns the ascii value of that byte/character. Even **if we pass a string, read method will only consider the first byte and returns the response** and ignores the rest of the bytes.

    public class Input {
        public static void main(String[] args) {

            int b = 0;
            try {
                System.out.print("Enter: ");
                b = System.in.read();
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println("Error: " + e);
            }
            System.out.println(b);

        }
    }

In the above code, if we pass "Surya" as an input, output will be 83 which is the ascii value for **S**. If we want to convert the ascii value to the character value we can typecast the value as follows.

    System.out.println((char)b); // S

## Buffered Reader

We can use BufferedReader to read a stream of bytes. Input can be user input / external devices / files which implements a **Reader Interface**. While initiating a bufferedReader object, we need to pass a Reader object for the bufferedReader constructor method.

**InputStreamReader** class implements Reader interface which we can use to create a Reader Object that converts byte stream to **character Stream**. There's a method called **readLine** on BufferedReader class which reads a byte stream and returns a string.

    InputStreamReader in = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(in);

    String s = "";
    try {
        System.out.print("Enter: ");
        s = br.readLine();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println("Error: " + e);
    }
    System.out.println(Integer.parseInt(s)); // might throw an exception if the string cannot be converted to an integer

If we passed an integer as an input, Output will be an String and if we need to convert the string to Integer, we can use `Integer.parseInt` method to parse the string to an integer. If the string can't be converted to an integer an exception will be thrown.

**Once our job is done with the reader, reader must be closed**. call close method on the bufferedReader object. closing a reader might throw an exception so wrap this statement with a try-catch block.

    InputStreamReader in = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(in);

    String s = "";
    try {
        System.out.print("Enter: ");
        s = br.readLine();
        br.close();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println("Error: " + e);
    }
    System.out.println(Integer.parseInt(s));

## Scanner Class

In the latest versions of java, Scanner class is introduced. Scanner works simillar to the BufferedReader with less boilerplate code. Scanner has a constructor method which takes a InputStream as a argument. It can be a file/ user inout etc. We can call `nextLine()` method on the scanner object which reads byte stream and returns a string.

    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("Enter: ");
    String str = sc.nextLine();
    sc.close();
    System.out.println("Scanner Text: "+str);

Usually we use finally block to close the connections as finally block will be executed irrespective of having an exception or not. br.close() might throw an exception. So wrapped with a try-catch block.

    String s = "";
    BufferedReader br = null;
    try {
        br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        System.out.print("Enter: ");
        s = br.readLine();

    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println("Error: " + e);
    } finally {
        try {
            br.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    System.out.println((s));

## Try with Resources

Instead of creating the reader and closing the reader in the finally block, in latest java \**try with resources*8 is introduced. We will create the inputReader object in the try block paranthesis so that when the try block is executed, it will be automatically closed.

    try (BufferedReader b = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
        String str = b.readLine();
        System.out.println(Integer.parseInt(str));
    } catch (IOException e) {
        System.out.println(e);
    }

Once try block is executed, br is automatically closed.
