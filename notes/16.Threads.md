# 16. Threads

Multitasking allows a computer to perform several activities concurrently. There are tow types of multi tasking.

- Process Based Multitasking
- Thread Based Multitasking

## Process Based Multitasking

Running multiple process concurrently. These two process are completely independent to each other.

**Example**<br>
Preparing a document in MS-Word and listening to music in Youtube in the Browser.

## Thread

**A Thread is a independent sequential path of execution within a program**. Threads allows a program to operate more efficiently by doing multiple things at the same time. Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the background without interrupting the main program.

## Thread Based Multitasking

Allows parts of the same program run concurrently. These threads are part of the same program and may or maynot be dependent on each other.

**Example**<br>
Preparing a document in Ms-Word [ Typing data - Thread 1 ] and simultaneously auto-correct feature suggesting words[ Auto Suggestions/Correct - Thread 2 ].

## Process vs Threads

Unlike processes, **Threads belong to the same address space as they are part of the same program**. So Communicating between threads is possible and cost of this operation is low. Also context switching between is less expensive compared to the processes.

In a single thread environment, Only one task can be performed at once. Whereas in Multithread environment, CPU cycles will be wasted when the program is waiting for user input. **We can utilize these idle CPU wait time to perform another task using threads**.

## Main Thread

Every program we run will have atleast one thread called **Main Thread**. When we run the code and main() method is executed, a thread will be generated automatically and this thread is called **Main Thread**.

    public class Threads {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread()); // Thread[main,5,main]
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()); // main
        }
    }

In the above example, we can use Thread class and use currentThread method to get the information about the current thread that's currently running. Here, When the main function is executed, Main Thread will be created and on calling currentThread method on the Thread class it returns the current thread details which we will be discussing later.

- If there are no other threads running, after main method finished executing, main thread will be destroyed.

- A program will be executed as long as user threads are still executing[ **Main thread is a user thread** ]. Program will be terminated even if Daemon threads are still running. JVM will terminate the daemon threads if there aren't any user threads running.

## Creating a Thread

In Java, threads can be created in 2 ways.

- We can extend a class with Thread class
- We can implement a class with Runnable interface

### Using Thread Class

In order to create a thread, we can create a class that extends Thread class. This new class should have a overriding method named **run** which should have the code we want to run when calling the thread we created.

    class Thread1 extends Thread{
        @Override
        public void run(){
            System.out.println("In Thread");
        }
    }

In order to use this thread in main code, we need to create the thread instance first and we need to call **start** method on the thread instance. **start method will call the run method we overrided in the thread class**. Here, Thread1 instance is created in Main method i.e, Main Thread. So, Thread1 is a **child of Main Thread**.

    public class Main{
        public static void main(String[] args){
            Thread t1 = new Thread1();
            t1.start(); // In Thread
        }
    }

start method will be executed and it is asynchronous in nature. So the remaining code might be executed first and then code in the run method might be executed. Even if the entire code in main method is executed, program will not be terminated as thread1 is still running [ Thread1 is a user thread ].

    class Thread1 extends Thread {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println("In Thread. Iteration: " + i);
            }
        }
    }

    public class Threads {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {

            System.out.println("Main");

            Thread1 t1 = new Thread1();
            t1.start();
            System.out.println("End");
        }
    }

**Output**<br>

    Main
    End
    In Thread. Iteration: 0
    In Thread. Iteration: 1
    In Thread. Iteration: 2
    In Thread. Iteration: 3
    In Thread. Iteration: 4

**Thread.currentThread()** returns a Thread Object with the following data.

- Thread Name
- Thread Priority
- Parent of the thread.

  class Thread1 extends Thread {
  @Override
  public void run() {
  System.out.println(Thread.currentThread());
  }
  }

  public class Threads {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
  Thread1 t1 = new Thread1();
  t1.start();
  }
  }

**Output**<br>

    Thread[Thread-0,5,main]

    // Name of the Thread : Thread- 0
    // Thread priority value - 5
    // Parent of the thread - main

By default, priority value for a thread will be **5**. Range of priority will be 1-10 where 1 is lowest and 10 is highest. We can assign priority value to a thread using **setPriority method**. Assigning priority will not ensure priority to the thread it depends on the JVM to run the threads based on the priority. So we cannot predict the output of the threads.

    class Thread1 extends Thread {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println("In Thread 1. Iteration: " + i);
            }
        }
    }

    class Thread2 extends Thread {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println("In Thread 2. Iteration: " + i);
            }
        }
    }

    public class Threads {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
            Thread1 t1 = new Thread1();
            Thread2 t2 = new Thread2();
            t2.setPriority(10);
            t1.start();
            t2.start();
        }
    }

Even though priority was set to max value for thread2 [ **instead of value 10, we can use Thread.MAX_PRIORITY** ], there's no guarantee that thread2 code will be executed first. If we run the same code multiple times, output will be different each time.

We can name out threads while initiating a Thread. To do that, while initiating a thread pass the name of the thread and in the thread class call the super method with the string. Thread class has a constructor method with string as a parameter.

    class Thread1 extends Thread {

        public Thread1(String name) {
            super(name);
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread());
        }
    }

    public class Threads {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
            Thread1 t1 = new Thread1("Thread-One");
            t1.start();
        }
    }

**Output** <br>

    Thread[Thread-One,5,main]

### Join Method

Using join method, we can make other **threads wait until the thread on which join method is called** is executed.

    class Thread1 extends Thread {

        public Thread1(String name) {
            super(name);
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("In Thread 1");
        }
    }

    public class Threads {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
            System.out.println("Main");

            Thread1 t1 = new Thread1("Thread-One");
            t1.start();

            System.out.println("End");
        }
    }

**Output**<br>

Main Thread will start executing and once the start method is called, run method will be called. Meanwhile, main method execution is done and since, user thread is still running program will not be terminated.

    Main
    End
    In Thread 1

**Using join method**

    class Thread1 extends Thread {

        public Thread1(String name) {
            super(name);
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("In Thread 1");
        }
    }

    public class Threads {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
            System.out.println("Main");

            Thread1 t1 = new Thread1("Thread-One");
            t1.start();
            t1.join():

            System.out.println("End");
        }
    }

**Output**<br>

    Main
    In Thread 1
    End

Main Thread starts executing and start method is called on thread1. And join method is called on thread1. So, main method will wait until thread1 done executing.

## Daemon Threads

**Daemon Threads** in java are **low-priority** threads that does **background tasks or provide services to the user threads**. When there are no user threads running, JVM will terminate the daemon threads if they are running and terminates the program.

**Daemon Threads has the least priority**. We can make a thread as Daemon Thread by calling the **setDaemon** method on the thread instance we created. setDaemon method takes a boolean value as argument. Passing **true** value to the setDaemon method makes the thread as a **Daemon Thread**.

:warning: **setDaemon method must be called before calling start method on the thread instance**.

    class Thread1 extends Thread {

        public Thread1(String name) {
            super(name);
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println("In Thread 1. Iteration: " + i);
            }
        }
    }

    public class Threads {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
            System.out.println("Main");

            Thread1 t1 = new Thread1("Thread-One");
            t1.setDaemon(true);
            t1.start();
            System.out.println("End");
        }
    }

**Output** [ :bangbang: Output might differ for each run ]

    Main
    End
    In Thread 1. Iteration: 0

Once the main thread is done executing, program terminates. Here, before main thread done executing thread1 started executing and one iteration is done. Because, Main thread is done executing and thread1 is a daemon thread program terminates.
